I first heard about the term “open source” after taking some basic programming classes and gaining an understanding of how to use code to build projects. I understand that open source means the source code of a project is publicly available, allowing developers to use it to facilitate their own coding processes.

Some advantages of open-source software include increased efficiency through code reuse and enhanced security, as bugs can be identified and fixed more quickly by the developer community.

In contrast, closed-source software follows a different approach and offers certain advantages that open-source projects might not achieve, such as consistency in coding standards and higher quality assurance, thanks to a predictable development cycle.

I have not contributed to any open-source projects before, but I decided to enroll in this open-source elective class because I believe that learning how to contribute to open-source projects will enhance my experience and be valuable for my resume, potentially helping me in my job search.

By the end of this class, I hope to gain hands-on experience in contributing to open-source projects or, ideally, to have already made meaningful contributions to existing projects.
